                Corruption is a huge bane to Africaâ€™s development. African countries must develop
                novel and localised solutions that will curb this menace, hence the birth of
                iReporter. iReporter enables any/every citizen to bring any form of corruption to
                the notice of appropriate authorities and the general public. Users can also report
                on things that needs government intervention
